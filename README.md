[![sampctl](https://shields.southcla.ws/badge/sampctl-Rogue_TDM-2f2f2f.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/RogueDrifter/Rogue_TDM)

## Usage

Build with:

```pawn
sampctl package ensure
sampctl package build
```

Use command:

```pawn
/jointdm
```
## Dependencies

Zcmd: https://github.com/Southclaws/zcmd

## Explanation

It's a basic TDM with cool features and sound effects + an intro.
What you can change within the script:
```
#define RTDM_EVENT_COLOR -1
#define RTDM_SKIN_RED_TEAM 212
#define RTDM_SKIN_BLUE_TEAM 287
#define RTDM_EVENT_ENTRYCASH 2500
```

## Updates

I plan on adding more textdraws and progressing for levels and upgrading weapons if i feel like its worth it.

## Credits

SovietComrade is credited for the map.
Zeex for the command processor, rest of the script is basically done by me.

## Features

Streamed music i uploaded myself (but didnâ€™t create, credits of those sounds go to their owners not me), textdraws, custom map (also not made by me), intro once you get inside the area and respawning ability.
```
forward OnPlayerExitTDM(playerid);
public OnPlayerExitTDM(playerid)
```
This function is called remotely from the filterscript, you can use it to reset player's weather (because its set once player enters the team deatmatch) and i couldn't retrieve it because there's no GetPlayerWeather function.
